## Quick Reference: Common Make Commands

### Setup and Infrastructure

```bash
make setup             # First-time setup: create .env + install all deps
make install           # Install all dependencies (server + frontend + SDKs)
make up                # Start full stack (docker compose up --build -d)
make down              # Stop the stack
make down.clean        # Stop + wipe all volumes
make ps                # Show running services
make logs              # Tail logs for all services
make logs.server       # Tail backend logs only
```

### Development

```bash
make dev.server        # Run backend dev server (hot-reload, port 8000)
make dev.frontend      # Run frontend dev server (hot-reload, port 3000)
make mcp.stdio         # Run MCP server in stdio mode (for Claude Code)
make mcp.http          # Run MCP server in HTTP mode (port 8001)
```

### Testing

```bash
make test              # Run all tests (server + frontend)
make test.server       # Backend tests only
make test.frontend     # Frontend tests only
make test.client       # SDK tests only
make test.unit         # Backend unit tests only
make test.integration  # Backend integration tests only
make test.verbose      # Verbose output with short tracebacks
make test.cov          # Backend tests with coverage report
```

### Quality

```bash
make lint              # Lint everything (ruff + mypy + ESLint + tsc)
make format            # Format Python code (ruff format + ruff check --fix)
make format.check      # Check formatting without modifying (CI mode)
make check             # Full quality gate: format.check + lint + test
make ci                # Full CI pipeline: install + check
```

### Database

```bash
make db.migrate        # Run Alembic migrations to latest
make db.rollback       # Roll back one migration
make db.revision MSG="add foo table"   # Create a new migration
make db.history        # Show migration history
```

### Build and Data

```bash
make build.all         # Build all Docker images + SDK wheel
make seed              # Load sample rules into a running stack
make reconcile         # Rebuild Neo4j graph from PostgreSQL
make health            # Check backend liveness (/healthz)
make ready             # Check backend readiness (all stores)
```
